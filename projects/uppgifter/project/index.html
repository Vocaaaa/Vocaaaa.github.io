            <h3 class="textt"> His osu! career started on 13 september 2020 and in <br>
                2 months of playing he achived rank #430k <br>
                which is really bad and he struggles to hit 50pp plays. <br>
                His accuracy is the only okay part about his profile coming in <br>
                at 91.29%. He sucks at holding combo which you can see at <br>
                his profile with the maximum combo only being 636. <br>
                His total play count is 4,600 and he has hit 510k circles in the<br>
                time he has played. His favorite song is BASS SLUT mapped by <br>
                the one and only Fatfan himself. <br>
                He reached 1,000pp on 29 October 2020 and his current total <br>
                pp is 1,304pp
                <br>
                <br>
                Total time played: 2d 10h 59m
                <br>
                <br>
                His top play is on Gravity Falls Theme Song - 16 Bit Mix <br>
                and its a whole 92pp with an accuracy of 96.30% which is good <br>
                for someone of his skill. As you can see he managed to hit 3 top plays <br>
                in only 1 day which is quite good. That day he gained quite a few ranks <br>
                (around 25k)
