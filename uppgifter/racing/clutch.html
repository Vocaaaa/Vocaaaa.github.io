    Clutch Discs 6 discs Stage6 R/T Derbi, 6 disc set from Stage6 R/T for 50cc mopeds<br>
     (with gearbox) with Derbi engine. 
<br>
<br>

    Stage6 R/T is the high-end tuning department of Stage6, and accordingly this 6-<br>
    disc clutch was developed and built for powerful high-end racing engines with 25<br>
     HP and more. What you usually have with very powerful engines is that the original <br>
     clutch is prone to slip, the engine's output is not effectively transmitted to the <br>
     wheel, and this means you will have to upgrade the clutch. </p>
     
     <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        The clutch consists of 6 friction discs with a special organic aramid-reinforced <br>
        lining, 5 plain discs and 5 clutch springs. The high-quality components guarantee a <br>
        very long service life and durability and a significant reduction of clutch slip even <br>
        with very powerful engines. </p>
        
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tip: Before mounting, soak the discs in gear oil overnight. </p>
