    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>MVT Internal Rotor Ignition "Digital Direct" with lighting coil Minarelli AM6,</strong> high-end<br> 
        racing ignition with its easily recognizable orange stator and black rotor.
<br>
<br>
        The MVT Digital Direct ignitions feature variable ignition timing controlled by a CDI<br>
         unit (included), meaning that ignition advance is rev-dependent in order to max out performance.<br>
          The HT coil provides a discharge current of up to 42,000 V at high rpm. In addition, the Digital Direct<br>
           features a 12 V supply for lighting or the electric water pump which is not common for most ignitions.<br>
        <br>
        Note: you really have to make sure what kind of vehicle you have (year, model) before ordering this ignition as it comes in several versions.<br>
         This one is compatible with Minarelli engines without wire harness (and without battery). For geared mopeds <br>
         with Minarelli AM6 engine EXCEPT MBK / Yamaha after 2003.
        <br>
        <br>
        You cannot use an electric choke with this ignition! </p>
